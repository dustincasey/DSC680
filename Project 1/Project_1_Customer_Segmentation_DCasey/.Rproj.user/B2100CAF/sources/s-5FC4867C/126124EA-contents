# EDA

# Histogram of Age
hist(segmentation_data$Age)

## The largest bucket of our customer base fall between 30 and 35 years old.
## Overall, the customer base is heavily favored to be under 50 years old.


# Histogram of Annual Income
hist(segmentation_data$`Annual Income (k$)`)

## The largest bucket here shows customers making between $70K and $80K per year.
## There is a small amount who make more than $80K per year.


# Histogram of Spending Score
hist(segmentation_data$`Spending Score (1-100)`)

## This metric has some variability, but the largest two buckets show between 40 and 60 for spending score.


# Gender Counts
table(segmentation_data$Gender)

## The majority of our customer base is female, but there is still a decent ratio of female to male.

# Transforming the Gender column to numeric. 1 for Male, 2 for Female
segmentation_data$Gender <- ifelse(segmentation_data$Gender == 'Male', 1, 2)


# K-Means Clustering

## Determining the number of clusters to use for the data.
wss <- (nrow(segmentation_data)-1)*sum(apply(segmentation_data,2,var))

for (i in 2:15) wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(segmentation_data,
                                     centers=i)$withinss)

plot(1:15, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
     ylab="Within groups sum of squares")

## Based off of the graph, using the elbow method, this dataset should use 5 clusters.

## Using K-Means to cluster similar customers that will help us with our segmentation and marketing efforts.
set.seed(777)

km.res <- kmeans(segmentation_data, 5, nstart = 10)

segmentation_data_clustered <- cbind(segmentation_data, cluster = km.res$cluster)
segmentation_data_clustered

## Cluster Size
km.res$size

## Good distribution between the 3 clusters


## Visualizing the clusters
plot(segmentation_data_clustered$`Annual Income (k$)`, 
     segmentation_data_clustered$`Spending Score (1-100)`, 
     col = segmentation_data_clustered$cluster,
     xlab = 'Annual Income (k$)',
     ylab = 'Spending Score (1-100)')
